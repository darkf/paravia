This is a modernized version of the [original C port](https://web.archive.org/web/20110104084432/http://pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=7183&lngWId=3) (by Thomas Knox) of the game [Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Paravia_en_Fiumaccio) (by George Blank), by darkf.

It reformats the code and brings the C port up to speed with the C99 standard, and adopts the CMake build system.

The code is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2 or later (at your discretion), as is the original port license.

To build, issue `cmake .` with whatever CMake generator you find yourself wanting to use.
